    "Do dessert recipes that use honey as the primary sweetener differ in caloric content, sugar content, and total fat (normalized to FDA daily values) compared to desserts that use sugar as the primary sweetener?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a control, we will filter recipes using the “desserts” tag and classified as honey-based or sugar-based using ingredient lists, restricting to recipes that contain only one primary sweetener. Then, we will define nutritional outcomes, specifically by total calories, sugar (% daily value), and total fat (% daily value) extracted from the nutrition column. As a method of comparison, we intend to use independent samples t-tests to compare mean nutritional values between honey and sugar desserts. We also intend to conduct downstream secondary analyses using ANOVAs, although we are yet to concretize the details for this, which we will likely do once our EDA is complete.Instructions: REPLACE the contents of this cell with your work, including any updates to recover points lost in your proposal feedback"

    "Desserts are often viewed as indulgent foods, but many people attempt to make them healthier by swapping refined sugar with alternative sweeteners such as honey. Honey is commonly perceived as more natural or wholesome, and this perception frequently appears in online dessert recipes. Our project investigates whether this substitution actually leads to differences in nutritional outcomes, or whether the perceived health benefits are not reflected in the final recipe nutrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is possible because of the availability of large-scale recipe datasets that include ingredient lists and structured nutrition information. In particular, Majumder et al. (2019) introduced and analyzed a processed Food.com dataset containing over 180,000 recipes and 700,000 user interactions, demonstrating that Food.com recipes can be reliably used for large-scale computational analysis and modeling.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Their work motivates our use of this dataset, as it shows that recipe ingredients and nutrition fields are sufficiently structured for systematic filtering and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a nutritional standpoint, honey and sugar are both primarily sources of carbohydrates, but they differ in caloric density. According to USDA FoodData Central, a tablespoon of honey contains more calories than a tablespoon of granulated sugar, meaning that replacing sugar with honey does not inherently reduce calorie content and may increase it if recipe quantities are not adjusted.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In practice, honey-based desserts are also often paired with additional ingredients such as butter, oils, or nuts, which may further increase fat and total calorie content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make nutritional comparisons more interpretable, we focus on calories and normalized measures such as sugar (% Daily Value) and total fat (% Daily Value). %DV is based on FDA nutrition labeling standards and provides a consistent benchmark for comparing nutrient levels across recipes with different serving sizes or formulations.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Using these measures allows us to compare honey-based and sugar-based desserts on a common scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "While prior work has used Food.com data for recipe modeling and personalization, there has been limited analysis specifically comparing honey-based and sugar-based desserts under strict filtering conditions (dessert tag and a single primary sweetener). Our project builds on existing work by applying clear inclusion criteria and standard statistical comparisons to evaluate whether these two classes of desserts differ meaningfully in their nutritional composition.\n",

    "We hypothesize that desserts using honey as the primary sweetener will have higher overall caloric content and slightly higher total fat compared to sugar-sweetened desserts when normalized to FDA daily values, while sugar (% daily value) may be comparable. Although honey is often perceived as a healthier alternative, it is more calorically dense than sugar (64 cal/g for 1 tablespoon of honey, as compared to 48 cal/g for 1 tablespoon of sugar), and recipes claiming to be 'healthy' may not reduce quantities enough to offset this difference. Additionally, honey-based desserts often include complementary fat sources (e.g., butter, oils, nuts), which may contribute to comparable or higher fat content.\n",

    "Instructions: \n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        The dataset we are using contains information on recipes from Food.com. There are many important metrics contained in this dataset, but for our specific research question, the nutrition column is especially relevant. This column is formatted as a list of floats as (calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)). \n",
    "        \n",
    "        Here are some of the most important metrics from this nutrition column: calories which is measured in kilocalories per serving and represents total energy content. Very high values (>800 kcal) indicate high energy density desserts.\n",
    "        Total fat which is measured in percent daily value. 100% DV means one serving meets the entire recommended daily intake for fat. Sugar, which is measured in percent daily value, indicates how much of the recommended daily sugar intake one serving provides. Values near or above 100% suggest extremely high sugar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Some additional columns are also necessary like the Tags column which has a list of strings which help us filter out desserts. Another column that is important is the Ingredients column which is a list of strings which help us determine the recipes that have the primary sweetener as either honey or sugar.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        One concern is that determining the primary sweetener requires inferring from the ingredients list. The dataset does not explicitly label honey or sugar as primary ingredients. Some recipes may include both honey and sugar, or use alternative sweeteners alongside them. Misclassification could blur differences between groups. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        Another concern is serving size variability. Nutritional values are reported per serving, but serving sizes are defined by the individual authors and are not standardized across all recipes. As a result, differences in calories or % Daily Value may partly reflect differences in portion definitions rather than true differences driven by the type of sweetener.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Similarly, the nutrition values may be estimated by the authors instead of being strictly tested and measured, which could also introduce potential measurement errors / variability.\n",

    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",

    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
