    "Do dessert recipes that use honey as the primary sweetener differ in caloric content, sugar content, and total fat (normalized to FDA daily values) compared to desserts that use sugar as the primary sweetener?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a control, we will filter recipes using the “desserts” tag and classified as honey-based or sugar-based using ingredient lists, restricting to recipes that contain only one primary sweetener. Then, we will define nutritional outcomes, specifically by total calories, sugar (% daily value), and total fat (% daily value) extracted from the nutrition column. As a method of comparison, we intend to use independent samples t-tests to compare mean nutritional values between honey and sugar desserts. We also intend to conduct downstream secondary analyses using ANOVAs, although we are yet to concretize the details for this, which we will likely do once our EDA is complete."

  "Desserts are often viewed as indulgent foods, but many people attempt to make them healthier by swapping refined sugar with alternative sweeteners such as honey. Honey is commonly perceived as more natural or wholesome, and this perception frequently appears in online dessert recipes. Our project investigates whether this substitution actually leads to differences in nutritional outcomes, or whether the perceived health benefits are not reflected in the final recipe nutrition.\n",
  "\n",
  "This analysis is possible because of the availability of large-scale recipe datasets that include ingredient lists and structured nutrition information. In particular, Majumder et al. (2019) introduced and analyzed a processed Food.com dataset containing over 180,000 recipes and 700,000 user interactions, demonstrating that Food.com recipes can be reliably used for large-scale computational analysis and modeling.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Their work motivates our use of this dataset, as it shows that recipe ingredients and nutrition fields are sufficiently structured for systematic filtering and analysis.\n",
  "\n",
  "From a nutritional standpoint, honey and sugar are both primarily sources of carbohydrates, but they differ in caloric density. According to USDA FoodData Central, a tablespoon of honey contains more calories than a tablespoon of granulated sugar, meaning that replacing sugar with honey does not inherently reduce calorie content and may increase it if recipe quantities are not adjusted.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In practice, honey-based desserts are also often paired with additional ingredients such as butter, oils, or nuts, which may further increase fat and total calorie content.\n",
  "\n",
  "To make nutritional comparisons more interpretable, we focus on calories and normalized measures such as sugar (% Daily Value) and total fat (% Daily Value). %DV is based on FDA nutrition labeling standards and provides a consistent benchmark for comparing nutrient levels across recipes with different serving sizes or formulations.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Using these measures allows us to compare honey-based and sugar-based desserts on a common scale.\n",
  "\n",
  "While prior work has used Food.com data for recipe modeling and personalization, there has been limited analysis specifically comparing honey-based and sugar-based desserts under strict filtering conditions (dessert tag and a single primary sweetener). Our project builds on existing work by applying clear inclusion criteria and standard statistical comparisons to evaluate whether these two classes of desserts differ meaningfully in their nutritional composition.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that desserts using honey as the primary sweetener will have higher overall caloric content and slightly higher total fat compared to sugar-sweetened desserts when normalized to FDA daily values, while sugar (% daily value) may be comparable. Although honey is often perceived as a healthier alternative, it is more calorically dense than sugar (64 cal/g for 1 tablespoon of honey, as compared to 48 cal/g for 1 tablespoon of sugar), and recipes claiming to be 'healthy' may not reduce quantities enough to offset this difference. Additionally, honey-based desserts often include complementary fat sources (e.g., butter, oils, nuts), which may contribute to comparable or higher fat content.\n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The dataset reflects recipes uploaded by users on Food.com (formerly GeniusKitchen) and cleaned by researchers at UC San Diego. Although there is a vast range of dietary preferences stored as tags, we acknowledge that the data may skew towards certain cultures and demographics, inhibiting its ability to generalize to other use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > We will only use recipe-level data (ingredients, tags, nutrition). We will not analyze usernames, reviews, or any identifiable user metadata. The analysis focuses on aggregate nutritional properties rather than individuals. Although the data does include user IDs, we will be getting rid of these during the wrangling process.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and does not contain sensitive personal data. It will be stored locally and we intend to maintain any change history on GitHub, specifically for coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The dataset is publicly accessible and local copies will likely be retained only for the duration of the course project. We might upload aggregated data but this will be clearly marked and identifiable as different from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > We intend to utilize a user's interpretation of features like 'healthy' and 'desserts' based on tags they assign to the uploaded recipe, which we acknowledged might be a biased perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > We will examine class balance (honey vs sugar desserts), ingredient labeling consistency (checking for membership instead of absolute comparison), and missing nutrition values. Filtering decisions (e.g., defining a “primary sweetener”) may introduce bias, which will be well-documented and reproducible in downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > All summary statistics and visualizations will be reported with clear note of assumptions, uncertainty, and limitations. The intention is to mimic our data in the way best intuitively understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > We will not analyze or display any user information which may be used to personally identify such individuals. We aim to keep all results at the recipe level.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > As we are completing all relevant work through GitHub and the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks, we believe that results and discoveries should be easily accessible to those seeking to review what we have done later in the future. We value transparency, which we hope, will be visible through GitHub and their commit history. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Although we selected calories, sugar and fat as our operational definition for healthiness, we understand that there are many other factors that can be taken into account in regards to physical health and diet. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    > When communicating our results, we aim to be clear that these statistics are based solely on the specific recipe which we have analyzed. Through such, we aim to avoid the perception that we are giving out advice regarding personal diets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > We would like to avoid instances in which our conclusions are interpreted as health recommendations. As such, we aim to portray our results from a statistical standpoint, rather than as a conclusion which should be served as a guideline for others. \n",
