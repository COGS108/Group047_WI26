    "We intend to isolate honey-only and sugar-only recipes tagged as 'desserts,' from the remainder of our dataset, undertaking other control measures if required. Once we filter and group our data, we will compare recipes across three nutritional outcomes: sugar content, total fat, and number of calories. To do this, we will employ statistical inference methods described in more detail below."

    "For our data, we aim to find a dataset which includes different foods; the data will hopefully contain columns such as ingredients, which we can then query down to find specific dishes/recipes which contain solely the ingredients honey, or sugar respectively. We aim to include data with a good sample size, likely of 100000 or more rows, which we can query down to at least 10000 or more results. We would prefer the data to be stored in CSV files, which we can then operate on using either pandas. \n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"

    "* We will communicate virtually over discord; We expect replies within six hours, providing ample time for us to update our project based on the comments/ suggestions made by others. We expect to meet up prior to submissions, with standard check-ins being done through messages.  \n",
    "* We decided that we would seek effective communication, not being afraid to be blunt when needed, as long as it is constructive and helpful towards our goals. We will still be mindful of being polite and respectful to the other members while doing so.\n",
    "* Our teams decision making will be made largely based on majority vote, with considerations made based on the scale of the decision being made. We do not believe it to be necessary to notify others prior to making commits, as we have git history to rely back on, however, if conflicts between ideas arise based on these commits, they will be discussed in the group chat, decided by majority. In the event that a team mate is unresponsive, we will continue to move forward without them; we will stop to make adjustments upon their return as needed.\n",
    "* We do not plan to assign leadership between members in regards to work, however, we will divide tasks, splitting up into smaller groups to complete work, or individually as we see fit. Tasks will be decided on preference, however, workload will be accounted for in the decision process. \n",
    "* See attatched below in the Project Timeline Proposal\n",
    "* In the event that someone is struggling to keep up, we expect communication at prior to the day before a deadline. Upon this, remaining members will discuss how to redistribute the workload. In the event that this continues to happen, a meeting may be set up to discuss how to fix the issue.\n",
